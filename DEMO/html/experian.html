<p>In the UK during the 1970s, GUS plc, a retail conglomerate with millions of customers paying for goods on credit, employed John Peace, a computer programmer at the time, to combine the mail order data from various GUS businesses and create a central database to which was later added electoral roll data as well as county court judgements.[3] GUS's database was commercialised in 1980 under the name Commercial Credit Nottingham (CCN).</p></div>
